# mayoclinicwebsite-repo

This website is a project that I'm working on to learn Flask and front-end development.

## How to set up

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repository-url>`
2.  Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the Flask backend: `python app.py`
4.  Open the `client/index.html` file in your browser.
